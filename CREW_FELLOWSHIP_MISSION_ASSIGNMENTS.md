## üóÇÔ∏è **CREW MISSION BRIEFING**

**The Mission**: Transform the **HYDRA of 11+ disconnected visualization systems** into a **UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE** that preserves the best features while eliminating redundancy and confusion.

**The Challenge**: We have a complete, sophisticated Rust backend that's **completely unreachable** from Python, plus multiple JavaScript engines and duplicate Python methods creating a confusing user experience.

**The Goal**: One clean Python API that seamlessly switches between backends (Jupyter widgets, static export, interactive streaming) while leveraging the existing high-quality implementations.

**The Strategy**: Use each crew member's specialized skills to tackle specific aspects of this massive architectural reconstruction.
