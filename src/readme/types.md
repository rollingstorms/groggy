# Types (types.rs)

Defines core types for Groggy graphs:

- `NodeId` — strongly-typed node identifier (string)
- `EdgeId` — strongly-typed edge identifier (tuple of NodeId)
- `GraphInfo` — graph metadata (name, directed, node/edge count, attributes)

**Python API:**
- Types are used throughout all collections and algorithms.

**Rust:**
- See `types.rs` for struct and trait details.
