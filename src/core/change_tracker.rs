//! Change Tracking System - Lightweight transaction management for graph modifications.
//!
//! ARCHITECTURE ROLE:
//! This component tracks what has changed since the last commit, enabling efficient
//! snapshots, rollbacks, and history creation. It's the "staging area" between
//! current mutable state and immutable history.
//!
//! DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
//! - Lightweight tracking (don't store full data, just record what changed)
//! - Delta-based approach (only track the differences)
//! - Fast rollback capability (essential for transactions)
//! - Efficient conversion to history deltas

/*
=== CHANGE TRACKING OVERVIEW ===

The change tracker serves as the "transaction log" for the current working state.
It records every modification since the last commit, allowing us to:

1. Create efficient deltas for history commits
2. Provide rollback functionality (reset to last commit)
3. Check if there are uncommitted changes
4. Generate summaries of what's been modified

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Track changes, not full state (memory efficient)
- Use append-only log for easy rollback
- Separate topology changes from attribute changes
- Support bulk operations efficiently

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

MEMORY EFFICIENCY:
- Only store the changes, not the full state
- Use Vec for append-only operations (very efficient)
- Consider using small vector optimization for common cases

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Recording changes: O(1) for most operations
- Checking if entity is modified: O(n) where n = number of changes for that entity
- Creating deltas: O(total_changes) - just clone the vectors
- Clearing: O(1) - just clear all vectors

OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
- Compress multiple changes to same attribute into single change
- Use bit vectors for tracking which entities have changed
- Consider using a more sophisticated data structure for frequent lookups

TRANSACTION SEMANTICS:
- Changes are recorded immediately when they happen
- Clearing the tracker "commits" the current state as the baseline
- Reverse operations provide rollback capability

CONFLICT DETECTION:
- Essential for branch merging functionality
- Conflicts occur when same entity/attribute is modified in different ways
- Provide detailed conflict information for user resolution

INTEGRATION WITH GRAPH:
- Graph calls record_* methods after successful operations
- Graph calls create_delta() when committing to history
- Graph calls clear() after successful commit
- Graph can call generate_reverse_operations() for rollback
