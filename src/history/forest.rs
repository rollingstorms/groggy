//! History System - Git-like version control for graph evolution.
//!
//! ARCHITECTURE ROLE: 
//! This is the version control backbone of the system. It manages immutable 
//! snapshots of graph state over time, with branching and merging capabilities.
//!
//! DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
//! - Immutable snapshots (states are never modified after creation)
//! - Content-addressed storage (deduplication via hashing)
//! - Git-like branching model (lightweight branches, merge capabilities)
//! - Efficient diff-based storage (only store what changed)

/*
=== HISTORY SYSTEM OVERVIEW ===

The history system is responsible for:
1. Creating immutable snapshots of graph state
2. Managing the DAG of state evolution (commits, branches, merges)
3. Providing time-travel capabilities (view graph at any point in history)
4. Handling branching and merging workflows
5. Garbage collection of unreachable states

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Store deltas (changes) rather than full snapshots for efficiency
- Use content addressing for automatic deduplication
- Separate metadata (who, when, why) from data (what changed)
- Support both linear history and complex branching workflows

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

STORAGE EFFICIENCY:
- Content-addressed deltas provide automatic deduplication
- Multiple commits with identical changes share the same Delta
- This is especially effective for automated commits or repeated patterns

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Creating commits: O(changes) - just store the delta
- Reconstructing state: O(depth) - need to apply all deltas from root
- Branch operations: O(1) - just update pointers
- Garbage collection: O(total_commits) - need to traverse the DAG

MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
- Use Arc<> for sharing deltas between commits
- Immutable data structures prevent accidental modification
- Garbage collection reclaims unreachable commits

BRANCHING MODEL:
- Lightweight branches (just pointers to commits)
- Support for merge commits (multiple parents)
- No special handling needed for branch creation/deletion

CONSISTENCY GUARANTEES:
- All operations are atomic (either succeed completely or not at all)
- Immutable commits ensure history can't be accidentally corrupted
- Content hashing detects corruption

FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Snapshot caching for frequently accessed states
- Compressed storage for large deltas
- Incremental garbage collection
- Parallel state reconstruction
