## Next Steps

1. **High Priority**: Fix failing test scripts 
2. **Medium Priority**: Improve argument patterns for methods with low success rates
3. **Documentation**: Use successful test patterns to generate comprehensive API docs
4. **Integration**: Incorporate these tests into the main Groggy test suite
