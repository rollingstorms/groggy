## ðŸ“… Overall Timeline & Dependencies

### Gantt Chart (Approximate)

```
Phase 1 (Builder Primitives): [======] (4-6 weeks) - Can start immediately
Phase 2 (Community):              [========] (6-8 weeks) - After Phase 1
Phase 3 (Centrality):             [======] (4-6 weeks) - After Phase 1
Phase 4 (Pathfinding):            [=====] (4-5 weeks) - After Phase 1
Phase 4A (Decomposition):            [========] (6-8 weeks) - After Phase 1
Phase 4B (Transform):                    [====] (3-4 weeks) - After Phase 1
Phase 4C (Temporal Algos):               [=====] (4-5 weeks) - After Temporal Plan
Phase 4D (Statistical):                      [====] (3-4 weeks) - After Phase 4A
Phase 5 (Meta Infra):                            [====] (3-4 weeks) - After Phase 1-4
Phase 6 (Polish):            [===================================] (Ongoing)
                                                       [===] (2-3 weeks final)

Temporal Extensions (see temporal-extensions-plan.md): [=========] (8-9 weeks, parallel)

Total: ~30-40 weeks (7-10 months) excluding temporal work
```

### Critical Path

1. **Temporal Extensions** run in parallel (see separate plan)
2. **Phase 1** (Builder) is prerequisite for Phases 2-4
3. **Phase 4A** (Decomposition) is prerequisite for Phase 4D and some Phase 2 algorithms
4. **Phase 6** (Polish) runs concurrently, with final push at end

### Parallelization Opportunities

- Phase 1 can start immediately alongside temporal work
- Phases 2, 3, 4 can run in parallel after Phase 1 completes
- Phase 4A-4D can be staggered with partial dependencies
- Phase 6 tasks distributed throughout (testing, docs as features land)
