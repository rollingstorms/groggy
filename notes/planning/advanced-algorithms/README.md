# Advanced Algorithm Roadmap

## üéØ Vision & Scope

This roadmap expands Groggy beyond the v0.5 foundations, layering in temporal analytics, advanced
algorithm suites, and richer builder/pipeline infrastructure. The goal is to establish Groggy as a
comprehensive graph analytics platform that balances performance (Rust core), composability (pipeline
architecture), and usability (Python DSL).

### Strategic Goals

**Temporal First-Class Citizenship** ‚Äì Treat change history as queryable time-series data, enabling
drift analysis, burst detection, and historical pattern mining without custom code.

**Algorithm Breadth** ‚Äì Cover the standard graph algorithm families (community, centrality, pathfinding,
decomposition, transform, statistical) so users reach for Groggy instead of stitching together
multiple libraries.

**Builder Maturity** ‚Äì Expand the step primitive catalog so custom algorithms can be composed in Python
without dropping into Rust, while maintaining performance through columnar execution.

**Production Readiness** ‚Äì Comprehensive testing, benchmarking, documentation, and error handling to
support mission-critical workloads.

### Non-Goals

**Complete Coverage** ‚Äì We focus on *commonly used* algorithms and patterns, not exhaustive catalogs.
Specialized or esoteric algorithms belong in extensions or community packages.

**Distributed Execution** ‚Äì Initial phases target single-machine performance. Distributed support
(partitioning, message passing) is a future extension.

**ML Integration** ‚Äì While we provide feature engineering primitives, deep learning / GNN integration
is out of scope for this roadmap.

## Note on Temporal Extensions

Temporal extensions are documented separately in `../temporal-extensions-plan.md` due to their complexity and scope. That plan covers:
- TemporalSnapshot and ExistenceIndex infrastructure
- TemporalIndex for efficient history queries
- AlgorithmContext temporal extensions
- Temporal algorithm steps (diff, window aggregation, filtering)
- Integration with existing systems
- Full implementation roadmap (8-9 weeks)

This roadmap focuses on expanding the non-temporal algorithm catalog and builder infrastructure.

## Quick Start

**For Algorithm Implementers**: Start with [Phase 1](PHASE_1_BUILDER_CORE.md) to understand the builder primitives, then move to your specific algorithm category (Phases 2-4).

**For Infrastructure Work**: See [Phase 5](PHASE_5_META_INFRASTRUCTURE.md) for meta-infrastructure and [Phase 6](PHASE_6_POLISH.md) for testing/polish work.

**For Project Planning**: Review [Metrics & Timeline](METRICS_AND_TIMELINE.md) for overall schedule and dependencies.
