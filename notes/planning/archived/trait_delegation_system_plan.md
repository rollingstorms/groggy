# Trait Delegation Stabilization Plan

## Objectives
- Replace magic `__getattr__` delegation with explicit, trait-backed PyO3 methods for Graph, Subgraph, Table, Array, and accessor surfaces.
- Centralize shared logic so that changes to a capability touch a single Rust implementation while Python wrappers stay declarative.
- Preserve prototyping velocity by providing a safe experimental lane that still honors trait contracts.
- Deliver type-discoverable APIs, regenerated stubs, and migration guidance for the first public release.

## Guiding Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: All algorithmic behavior lives in Rust traits or shared helpers; FFI layers only marshal and expose.
- **Explicit Over Magic**: Every Python-facing method is written out explicitly in `#[pymethods]` blocks for discoverability and maintainability. No macro-generated wrappers, no hidden delegation.
- **Trait-Backed Implementation**: Methods delegate to Rust trait implementations through lightweight helpers (like `with_full_view`) to avoid code duplication while keeping the PyO3 surface explicit and readable.
- **Default Implementations First**: Trait defaults provide the common behavior so adding or editing a method usually requires touching one Rust function, then adding the explicit PyO3 wrapper.
- **Safety & Performance**: Maintain existing error translation, release the GIL around heavy operations via `py.allow_threads()`, and stay within the 100ns per-call FFI budget.
- **Open Source Maintainability**: Code should be understandable by new contributors. Explicit methods beat clever metaprogramming.

## Phase Breakdown

### Progress Log
- **2025-01-XX Phase 2 Complete + Phase 3 Batch 1**: Implemented `with_full_view` helper and added 8 explicit delegation methods to `PyGraph`:
  1. ✅ `connected_components()` - Full implementation using trait method
  2. ⚠️  `clustering_coefficient(node_id=None)` - Placeholder (not in core yet)
  3. ⚠️  `transitivity()` - Placeholder (not in core yet)
  4. ✅ `has_path(source, target)` - Full implementation via BFS
  5. ✅ `sample(k)` - Full implementation
  6. ✅ `induced_subgraph(nodes)` - Full implementation with trait object conversion
  7. ✅ `subgraph_from_edges(edges)` - Full implementation with trait object conversion
  8. ✅ `summary()` - Full implementation
  
  All methods tested and working. Methods 2 & 3 correctly raise `NotImplementedError` until core algorithms are added.
  
  **Total PyGraph Methods**: 79 (71 existing + 8 new)  
  **Architecture**: Explicit-over-macro approach established  
  **Pattern**: All methods use `with_full_view` helper for consistency
- **2024-05-09 Phase 6 Docs/Stubs**: Completed type stub regeneration and documentation. Attempted `cargo bench` for FFI baseline, but compilation failed due to outdated helper APIs in the benchmark harness. Logged details in `documentation/performance/ffi_baseline.md`.

- **2025-01-XX Phase 3 Extended**: Extended `PyGraph` with 15 additional explicit methods: `node_count`, `edge_count`, `has_node`, `has_edge`, `density`, `filter_nodes`, `filter_edges`, `has_edge_between`, `node_ids`, `edge_ids`, `is_empty`, `degree`, `in_degree`, `out_degree`, and `neighbors`. These are high-traffic methods identified from test suite analysis. All follow the `with_full_view` pattern for consistency and performance.

- **2025-01-XX Phase 3 Complete - PySubgraph**: Extended explicit methods to `PySubgraph` class:
  - Added 12 explicit methods mirroring PyGraph pattern
  - Methods: `connected_components`, `clustering_coefficient`, `transitivity`, `has_path`, `sample`, `neighborhood`, `to_nodes`, `to_edges`, `to_matrix`, `edges_table`, `calculate_similarity`, `degree`
  - All use `with_full_view` pattern for consistency
  - `__getattr__` retained only for intentional dynamic patterns (attribute dictionaries)

- **2025-01-XX Phase 3 Complete - Table Classes**: Extended explicit methods to table classes:
  - **PyGraphTable**: Added explicit methods for `select`, `filter`, `sort_by`, `group_by`, `join`, `unique`, aggregations
  - **PyNodesTable**: Inherits PyGraphTable methods + direct delegation to `nodes` accessor
  - **PyEdgesTable**: Inherits PyGraphTable methods + direct delegation to `edges` accessor
  - `__getattr__` retained only for column access (intentionally dynamic pattern)
  - Clear inline comments documenting why dynamic patterns remain

### Phase 0 – Inventory & Success Criteria (In Progress)
- Build a canonical spreadsheet or `documentation/planning/trait_delegation_matrix.md` that lists every currently delegated Python method, its owning type, parameters, return value, and the Rust implementation (trait or concrete) that should back it.
- Annotate gaps in that matrix with a proposed trait home (existing or new) and flag required new data types or error variants.
- Define exit criteria: zero TODO rows, traceability from each dynamic method to a trait signature, and a signed-off checklist by Bridge (FFI) and Rusty (core) describing what “explicit exposure” means for release.
- Capture migration risks uncovered during the inventory (e.g., methods returning pandas objects) and link them into `documentation/planning/risks.md` for tracking in later phases.
- **Design example** – draft table row to validate the catalog format before scaling:

```markdown
| Python Owner        | Method          | Current Path        | Target Trait       | Notes                      |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| `PyGraph`           | `filter_nodes`  | `__getattr__` → Subgraph | `SubgraphOps` (new default) | Needs query parser helper |
```

### Phase 1 – Trait Surface Consolidation
- Update `src/traits/` modules so each capability in the inventory has a trait signature; prefer default method implementations that call shared helpers in `src/helpers/` (create if missing).
- Introduce companion traits where behavior spans domains (e.g., `SimilarityOps` for Graph/Subgraph comparisons, `HierarchyOps` for meta-node flows) and supply blanket impls for types meeting minimal bounds.
- Refactor duplicated logic in concrete types (`src/subgraphs/subgraph.rs`, `src/storage/table/base.rs`, etc.) into reusable free functions or structs (e.g., `merge_core`, `edges_table_core`) consumed by the trait defaults; ensure unit tests cover the extracted helpers before deleting the old copies.
- Document the trait extension in `documentation/planning/trait_surface_changelog.md`, noting which Python behaviors map to new defaults versus override-required methods, so later phases know when specialization is expected.
- **Design example** – confirm trait/default pattern before mass adoption:

```rust
pub trait SubgraphOps: GraphEntity {
    fn edges_table(&self) -> GraphResult<EdgesTable> {
        edges_table_core(self.graph_ref(), self.edge_set())
    }

    fn filter_nodes(&self, filter: &NodeFilter) -> GraphResult<Box<dyn SubgraphOps>>;
}

impl SubgraphOps for Subgraph {
    fn filter_nodes(&self, filter: &NodeFilter) -> GraphResult<Box<dyn SubgraphOps>> {
        filter_nodes_core(self, filter)
    }
}
```

### Phase 2 – Adapter Helpers & Explicit Wrappers (Revised Approach)
- Create lightweight helper functions (like `with_full_view`) in `python-groggy/src/ffi/api/` modules that standardize how PyO3 types access their underlying Rust trait implementations.
- For each Python class (PyGraph, PySubgraph, PyNodesTable, etc.), add explicit `#[pymethods]` that:
  - Call through to Rust trait implementations via the helpers
  - Provide clear error translation via `map_err(graph_error_to_py_err)`
  - Include proper docstrings matching the trait documentation
  - Use `py.allow_threads(|| ...)` for long-running operations
- Document the pattern in `documentation/planning/delegation_pattern_guide.md` with examples showing how to add new methods.
- **No macro generation**: Methods are written explicitly for discoverability and maintainability. The trait provides the single source of truth, the PyO3 method is the thin wrapper.
- **Design example** – explicit wrapper using helper:

```rust
/// Find connected components in the graph.
pub fn connected_components(
    slf: PyRef<Self>,
    py: Python,
) -> PyResult<PyComponentsArray> {
    Self::with_full_view(slf, py, |subgraph, _py| {
        let components = subgraph
            .inner
            .connected_components()  // Trait method
            .map_err(graph_error_to_py_err)?;
        Ok(PyComponentsArray::from_components(components, subgraph.inner.graph().clone()))
    })
}
```

### Phase 3 – PyO3 Surface Expansion
- For each class (PyGraph, PySubgraph, PyNodesTable, PyEdgesTable, PyBaseArray), systematically add explicit methods for all operations in the catalog that currently go through `__getattr__`.
- Follow the pattern established by existing explicit methods and the `with_full_view` helper.
- Retain dynamic lookups only for intentionally dynamic patterns (attribute dictionaries, column projections). Add inline comments explaining why these remain dynamic.
- Organize methods in logical groups within the `#[pymethods]` block (topology, analysis, conversion, etc.) for readability.
- Add integration tests confirming that formerly dynamic methods are now resolved statically and visible via `dir()` / stub inspection.
- Document each batch of methods added in the Progress Log with: method names, which class, and verification that tests pass.
- **Design example** – organized method blocks:

```rust
#[pymethods]
impl PyGraph {
    // === TOPOLOGY OPERATIONS ===
    pub fn node_count(&self) -> usize { ... }
    pub fn edge_count(&self) -> usize { ... }
    pub fn has_path(...) -> PyResult<bool> { ... }
    
    // === ANALYSIS OPERATIONS ===
    pub fn connected_components(...) -> PyResult<PyComponentsArray> { ... }
    pub fn clustering_coefficient(...) -> PyResult<f64> { ... }
    
    // === CONVERSION OPERATIONS ===
    pub fn to_networkx(...) -> PyResult<PyObject> { ... }
}
```

### Phase 4 – Experimental + Feature Flags
- Introduce a Cargo feature `experimental-delegation` and a matching Python environment toggle (e.g., `GROGGY_EXPERIMENTAL=1`) that conditionally compiles or registers prototype trait methods.
- Provide a standard workflow in `documentation/planning/prototyping.md`: add trait method with placeholder default, guard the PyO3 exposure behind the feature, iterate in notebooks, then remove the guard when stable.
- Implement `PyGraph.experimental(method_name: str, *args, **kwargs)` as a thin wrapper that checks the registry of experimental trait methods (populated when the feature is on) to keep rapid iteration ergonomic without magic attribute access.
- Add automated tests ensuring the flag flips behaviors correctly (e.g., methods hidden when disabled) and update CI to run both default and experimental builds at least nightly.
- **Design example** – Rust feature gate plus Python call site:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "experimental-delegation")]
impl GraphOps for GraphAdapter {
    fn pagerank(&self, damping: Option<f64>) -> GraphResult<NodesTable> {
        experimental::pagerank_core(self.graph, damping)
    }
}
```

```python
if os.getenv("GROGGY_EXPERIMENTAL"):
    pr = graph.experimental("pagerank", damping=0.9)
```

### Phase 5 – Tooling, Stubs, and Docs
- Extend `scripts/generate_stubs.py` to read the delegation registry (macro manifests or adapters) so `.pyi` files stay in sync; include validation that stub signatures match the trait definitions.
- Update developer and user docs (`docs/api_reference.md`, persona guides under `documentation/planning/personas/`) to reflect the explicit methods and new prototyping guidance.
- Author a migration guide in `documentation/releases/trait_delegation_cutover.md` outlining deprecated dynamic paths, recommended replacements, code samples, and timeline for removal of compatibility shims.
- Coordinate with the docs squad to review notebooks and tutorials, ensuring code samples reference the explicit API and no longer rely on hidden delegation.
- **Design example** – stub generation snippet demonstrating derived signature:

```python
# Inside scripts/generate_stubs.py
for method in delegation_registry.graph_methods():
    stub_writer.write_def(
        name=method.python_name,
        args=method.stub_args(),
        returns=method.stub_return_type(),
        doc=method.docstring,
    )
```

### Phase 6 – Validation & Cutover
- Execute the full Rust and Python test matrix: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all`, targeted benches (`cargo bench` for hot traits), `maturin develop --release`, and `pytest tests -q`.
- Run smoke tests on notebooks/persona workflows and capture before/after API inspection (`dir()`, stub introspection) to demonstrate improved discoverability.
- Profile critical FFI calls pre- and post-cutover; record metrics in `documentation/performance/ffi_baseline.md` and highlight any regression mitigations.
- Remove deprecated dynamic paths, guard rails, and feature flags scheduled for sunset; ensure release notes summarize changes, testing, and compatibility status.
- Hold a final sign-off review with Bridge (FFI), Rusty (core), Docs, and QA; archive the plan and checklist results for future releases.
- **Design example** – validation command block for release checklist:

```bash
cargo fmt --all && \
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && \
cargo test --all && \
cargo bench -p groggy --bench ffi_hot_paths && \
maturin develop --release && \
pytest tests -q
```
