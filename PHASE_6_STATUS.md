# Phase 6 - Validation & Cutover Status

## Current State Summary

According to the trait delegation system plan and code inspection, the following phases are **COMPLETE**:

### ✅ Phase 1 - Trait Surface Consolidation
- Traits exist in `src/traits/` with appropriate signatures
- Methods use shared helpers and default implementations

### ✅ Phase 2 - Adapter Helpers & Explicit Wrappers
- `with_full_view` helper implemented in `PyGraph`
- Pattern established for explicit delegation through trait methods
- Methods use `map_err(graph_error_to_py_err)` for error translation
- GIL release via `py.allow_threads()` where appropriate

### ✅ Phase 3 - PyO3 Surface Expansion

#### PyGraph (79 methods total)
- 8 initial explicit methods (connected_components, clustering_coefficient, transitivity, has_path, sample, induced_subgraph, subgraph_from_edges, summary)
- 15 high-traffic methods (node_count, edge_count, has_node, has_edge, density, etc.)
- 56 other existing methods (adjacency_list, bfs, dfs, filter_nodes, filter_edges, neighbors, etc.)
- **Dynamic delegation retained ONLY for**: Node/edge attribute dictionaries (e.g., `graph.salary` returns `{node_id: value}`)

#### PySubgraph (66 methods)
- 12 explicit methods using `with_full_view` pattern
- 54 other existing methods
- **Dynamic delegation retained ONLY for**: Node/edge attribute dictionaries within subgraph scope

#### Table Classes
- **PyGraphTable**: Explicit methods for select, filter, sort_by, group_by, join, unique, aggregations
- **PyNodesTable**: Inherits PyGraphTable methods + direct delegation to nodes accessor
- **PyEdgesTable**: Inherits PyGraphTable methods + direct delegation to edges accessor
- **Dynamic delegation retained ONLY for**: Column access (e.g., `table.column_name` → `table['column_name']`)
- All __getattr__ methods have **INTENTIONAL DYNAMIC PATTERN** comments documenting why they remain

### ✅ Phase 4 - Experimental + Feature Flags
- Cargo feature `experimental-delegation` in `python-groggy/Cargo.toml`
- `ExperimentalRegistry` with thread-safe initialization
- `PyGraph.experimental(method_name, *args, **kwargs)` method
- Prototyping workflow documented in `documentation/planning/prototyping.md`

### ✅ Phase 5 - Tooling, Stubs, and Docs
- Enhanced stub generation with experimental method detection
- Migration guide (~17,000 words) created
- Persona guides updated (Bridge FFI Manager)
- API documentation framework established

## Phase 6 - Validation & Cutover

### What Phase 6 Requires

From the plan:
```
- Execute the full Rust and Python test matrix: 
  * cargo fmt --all
  * cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
  * cargo test --all
  * targeted benches (cargo bench for hot traits)
  * maturin develop --release
  * pytest tests -q
  
- Run smoke tests on notebooks/persona workflows
- Capture before/after API inspection (dir(), stub introspection)
- Profile critical FFI calls pre- and post-cutover
- Record metrics in documentation/performance/ffi_baseline.md
- Remove deprecated dynamic paths, guard rails, and feature flags scheduled for sunset
- Hold final sign-off review with Bridge (FFI), Rusty (core), Docs, and QA
```

### Current Test Status

**Python Tests**: ✅ **PASSING**
```
382 passed, 19 skipped in 0.32s
```

**Rust Tests**: ⚠️ **COMPILATION ERRORS** (unrelated to trait delegation work)
- Issues in `src/storage/adjacency.rs` (test code calling `.len()` on Result without unwrapping)
- These are pre-existing issues, not introduced by trait delegation changes

### Remaining Phase 6 Tasks

1. **Fix Rust compilation errors** (unrelated to delegation, but blocking full test suite)
2. **Run formatting and linting**:
   - `cargo fmt --all`
   - `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` (after fixing compile errors)
3. **Execute benchmarks** on hot FFI paths to validate no performance regression
4. **Generate and validate .pyi stubs** using `scripts/generate_stubs.py`
5. **Test notebook examples** to ensure documented APIs work
6. **Profile FFI call overhead** and document in `documentation/performance/ffi_baseline.md`
7. **Update progress log** in `trait_delegation_system_plan.md`
8. **Final review** and sign-off

### Key Achievement

The architecture goal has been achieved:
- ✅ **Explicit PyO3 methods** - Every method is written out for discoverability
- ✅ **Shared Rust traits** - Logic lives in traits with defaults, Python wrappers stay thin
- ✅ **Lightweight adapters** - `with_full_view` helper avoids duplication
- ✅ **No macro system** - Clear, maintainable code
- ✅ **Plan-driven execution** - Progress tracked and documented
- ✅ **Dynamic patterns documented** - `__getattr__` only for intentional use cases (attribute dicts, column access)

### What's NOT Done

According to the Deliverables Checklist in the plan:
- [ ] Trait methods covering the full delegated surface - **claimed "~10% complete"** but actually more like **90% complete** based on code inspection
- [ ] Helper functions for each type - **PyGraph complete, PySubgraph complete, Tables complete**
- [ ] PyO3 classes expose all methods explicitly - **DONE** (dynamic delegation limited to documented cases)
- [ ] Updated stubs (.pyi files) - **Needs regeneration**
- [ ] Full test/bench suite executed - **Python tests pass, Rust tests have unrelated compile errors, benches not run**

The checklist in the plan is outdated - actual implementation is much further along than documented.
