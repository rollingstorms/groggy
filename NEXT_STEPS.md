## ðŸ”„ ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### Python API Enhancements
- [ ] **Update Python API for string-based node IDs and convenient syntax**:
  ```python
  # Target API (more Pythonic):
  g.add_node("alice", age=30, role="engineer")  # string IDs + kwargs
  g.add_edge("alice", "bob", relationship="collaborates")
  alice_data = g.get_node("alice")  # direct node access
  engineers = g.filter_nodes(lambda id, attrs: attrs.get("role") == "engineer")
  g.add_nodes([{'id': 'user_1', 'score': 100}])  # batch with dicts
  ```
  **Implementation Requirements** (Much of this is already done in benchmark_graph_libraries.py!):
  - [x] String-to-numeric ID mapping âœ… Already implemented in benchmarks
  - [x] Dict to AttrValue conversion âœ… Already implemented for bulk operations
  - [x] Node/edge data restructuring âœ… Already working in benchmark code
  - [ ] Move existing conversion logic from benchmarks into core Python API
  - [ ] Add kwargs support: `add_node("alice", age=30, role="engineer")`
  - [ ] **Pythonic filtering system** (More complex - needs design):
    ```python
    # Current (verbose):
    eng_filter = gr.NodeFilter.attribute_equals("department", gr.AttrValue("Engineering"))
    high_sal = gr.AttributeFilter.greater_than(gr.AttrValue(120000))
    salary_filter = gr.NodeFilter.attribute_filter("salary", high_sal)
    
    # Target (Pythonic):
    engineers = g.filter_nodes(lambda n: n["department"] == "Engineering")
    high_earners = g.filter_nodes(lambda n: n["salary"] > 120000)
    complex_filter = g.filter_nodes(lambda n: n["dept"] == "Engineering" and n["salary"] > 120000)
    ```
    **Challenge**: Lambda execution in Rust requires PyO3 callbacks + attribute lookup
  - [ ] Property access: `len(g.nodes)`, `len(g.edges)`
  - [ ] Simplified convenience methods like `g.has_edge(source, target)`

### Core Version Control Enhancements
- [ ] Implement full state isolation for branch checkout (currently basic)
- [ ] Add commit diff visualization and comparison tools
- [ ] Implement merge commit support with conflict resolution
- [ ] Add tag support for marking release points

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Graph merging and automatic conflict resolution
- [ ] Persistence layer (save/load graph states from disk)
- [ ] Advanced query patterns (graph traversal queries, pattern matching)
- [ ] Multi-graph operations and graph unions

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Add adjacency lists for O(1) neighbor queries (currently O(log n))
- [ ] Implement graph compression for large datasets
- [ ] Add indexing for attribute queries (current: linear scan)
- [ ] Benchmark with datasets >10K nodes for scalability testing
- [ ] SIMD optimizations for bulk operations

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive `cargo test` unit test suite
- [ ] Integration tests for edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Property-based testing with QuickCheck
- [ ] Performance regression tests and CI benchmarks
- [ ] Fuzzing tests for robustness

### Documentation & Ecosystem
- [ ] Generate API documentation with `cargo doc`
- [ ] Architecture guide explaining internal design
- [ ] Python usage tutorials and cookbook
- [ ] Performance characteristics guide
- [ ] Publish to crates.io and PyPI
