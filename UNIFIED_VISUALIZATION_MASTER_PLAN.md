# UNIFIED VISUALIZATION SYSTEM - MASTER PLANNING DOCUMENT
*Comprehensive Architecture Plan with Persona Team Consultation*

## Executive Summary

### The Vision
Transform Groggy's visualization system from **4 separate methods** to **1 unified command** with **backend switching**. The goal is context-aware rendering that adapts whether you're in Jupyter, Python CLI, or future standalone Groggy bash:

```python
# The Universal Command
g.viz().render(backend='jupyter')     # Context-aware Jupyter embedding
g.viz().render(backend='streaming')   # WebSocket interactive server  
g.viz().render(backend='file')        # Static export (HTML/SVG/PNG)
g.viz().render(backend='local')       # Self-contained HTML
```

### Strategic Implications
- **Single Template Engine**: All backends share data extraction, layout, theming
- **Context Detection**: Auto-adapts to Jupyter vs Python vs CLI environments  
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for standalone Groggy bash program
- **Unified Styling**: Consistent experience across tables, arrays, matrices, graphs
- **Enhanced Features**: Easier to add adjacency matrix viewer, animation backends
