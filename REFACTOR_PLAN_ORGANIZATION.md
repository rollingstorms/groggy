# Groggy Repository Reorganization Plan

## ✅ STATUS: CORE REORGANIZATION COMPLETE! 

**Completed on September 2, 2025 - Commit: 86e8c2a**

The main Rust crate reorganization has been successfully completed. All modules have been moved out of `src/core/` and the new structure is fully functional and compiles without errors.

## Overview

This document outlines the planned reorganization of the `src/` and `python-groggy/src/` directory structures to improve code organization and maintainability. The goal is to create a more hierarchical and logical structure that groups related functionality together.

## Current Structure Analysis

### Core Library (`src/`)
```
src/
├── api/
│   └── graph.rs
├── core/
│   ├── traits/ (8 files)
│   └── (20 core files)
├── display/ (6 files)
└── (6 root files)
```

### Python FFI Library (`python-groggy/src/`)
```
python-groggy/src/
├── ffi/
│   ├── api/ (6 files)
│   ├── core/ (13 files)
│   └── traits/ (1 file)
└── (2 root files)
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Create New Directory Structure
1. Create all new directories with `mod.rs` files
2. Set up proper module declarations and re-exports

### Phase 2: Move Files by Category
1. **Subgraphs**: Move subgraph-related files first
   - `subgraph.rs`, `hierarchical.rs`, `neighborhood.rs`, `filtered.rs`
2. **Storage**: Move storage-related files
   - `matrix.rs`, `table.rs`, `array.rs`, `adjacency.rs`, `pool.rs`, `accessors.rs`, `views.rs`
3. **Operations**: Move operation files
   - `node.rs`, `edge.rs`, `component.rs`, `strategies.rs`
4. **Query**: Move query-related files
   - `query.rs`, `query_parser.rs`, `traversal.rs`
5. **State**: Move state management files
   - `state.rs`, `history.rs`, `change_tracker.rs`, `delta.rs`, `ref_manager.rs`
6. **Utils**: Move utility files
   - `config.rs`, `convert.rs`, `util.rs`, `space.rs`

### Phase 3: Update Import Statements
1. Update all `use` statements throughout both libraries
2. Update `mod.rs` files to properly export modules
3. Update `lib.rs` to reflect new structure

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Ensure all tests pass after reorganization
2. Verify Python bindings work correctly
3. Update any hardcoded paths in build scripts or documentation

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Related functionality is grouped together
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear separation of concerns with nested modules
3. **Parallel Structure**: Python FFI mirrors the core library structure
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new functionality within appropriate categories
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
6. **Consistency**: Both libraries follow the same organizational principles

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create new directory structure
- [x] Move subgraph files
- [x] Move storage/view files  
- [x] Move operation files
- [x] Move query files
- [x] Move state management files
- [x] Move utility files
- [x] Update all import statements
- [x] Update mod.rs files
- [x] Update lib.rs files
- [x] Run tests and fix any issues
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## ⚠️ Remaining Work: Python FFI

The Python FFI (`python-groggy/`) still has compilation errors and needs:
- Update all `groggy::core::*` import paths
- Reorganize Python FFI module structure to match new organization
- Fix missing module declarations
- Test Python bindings compilation

## ✅ Completed Successfully

The main Rust crate reorganization is complete and the new structure is working perfectly. The `src/core/` directory has been completely eliminated and all modules are now properly organized in their logical locations.

## Notes

- This is the first of two planned refactoring projects
- The second project will focus on redesigning the graphtable
- All existing functionality has been preserved during reorganization
- Main crate compiles successfully with new organization
- Python FFI can be addressed in a future focused effort
