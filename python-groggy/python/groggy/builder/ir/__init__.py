"""
Intermediate Representation (IR) for algorithm optimization.

This module provides data structures and utilities for building and
optimizing algorithm IR before execution. Future phases will add:
- Expression tree analysis
- Fusion pattern detection
- Optimization passes (DCE, CSE, LICM)
"""

# IR infrastructure will be added in Phase 5
