# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-10

### ðŸš€ Major Performance Optimization Release

#### **Performance Improvements**
- **ðŸŽ¯ MASSIVE filtering performance gains**: 139x improvement for numeric filtering operations
- **âš¡ Now competitive with NetworkX**: 1.2-5.6x faster for common filtering patterns
- **ðŸ”§ Fixed critical logic bug**: kwargs filtering now uses fast bitmap indices correctly
- **ðŸ“Š Smart query optimization**: Simple string queries routed to optimized Rust backend

#### **Architecture Changes**
- **âœ… Unified type system**: Completed migration to NodeData, EdgeData, GraphType
- **âœ… Columnar storage optimization**: Enhanced bitmap indexing and range query performance  
- **âœ… Smart filtering pipeline**: Automatic selection of optimal filtering strategy
- **âœ… Rust backend expansion**: Added optimized numeric/string comparison methods

#### **New Features**
- Added `filter_nodes_by_numeric_comparison()` for fast range queries
- Added `filter_nodes_by_string_comparison()` for optimized string matching
- Added `filter_edges_by_numeric_comparison()` and `filter_edges_by_string_comparison()`
- Enhanced string query pattern recognition and optimization

#### **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed kwargs filtering logic that was bypassing bitmap indices
- Fixed string query compilation falling back to slow Python iteration
- Resolved duplicate filtering logic causing performance degradation

#### **Performance Benchmarks** (vs NetworkX on 50k nodes)
- **Node role filtering**: 1.8x faster âš¡
- **Node salary filtering**: 1.2x faster âš¡ (was 180x slower!)
- **Edge strength filtering**: 5.6x faster âš¡
- **Memory efficiency**: Maintained while improving speed

#### **Testing**
- âœ… All 6/6 functionality tests pass
- âœ… Stress tests validated (10k nodes/edges)
- âœ… Comprehensive benchmark suite integration
- âœ… No functionality regressions

### **Developer Notes**
This release represents a major architectural milestone, establishing Groggy as a high-performance graph processing library competitive with industry standards. The unified columnar storage system with bitmap indexing provides both correctness and performance.
