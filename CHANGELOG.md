---

### üéØ Breaking Changes

**Minimal - Mostly Internal**:
- FFI module reorganization (internal, not user-facing)
- Some internal debugging APIs may have changed
- Graph bundle format updated (forward compatible)

**Python API remains largely compatible** - existing code should work with minimal changes.

---


### üöÄ Upgrade Guide

#### From v0.4.0

Most existing code will work without changes:

```python
import groggy as gr

# Existing code continues to work
g = gr.Graph()
g.add_node("alice", age=30)
g.add_edge("alice", "bob", weight=0.8)
subgraph = g.connected_components()[0]
```

**New capabilities available**:

```python
# Visualization
g.viz.show()  # Interactive visualization in Jupyter
g.viz.save("graph.html")  # Export to standalone HTML

# Type stubs for IDE autocomplete
g.nodes.  # <-- Full autocomplete available!

# Advanced table operations
table = g.nodes.table()
grouped = table.groupby("department").agg({"age": "mean"})
table.to_csv("nodes.csv")

# Matrix operations with auto-diff
import groggy.neural as gn
matrix = g.adjacency_matrix()
activation = gn.relu(matrix)
gradient = activation.backward()

# Meta-API discovery
from groggy.imports import discover_api
api_graph = discover_api(gr.Graph)
```
