## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Strategy

### Hybrid Dynamic/Static Approach

```python
# Proposed architecture combining dynamic discovery with curated patterns
class EnhancedRepositoryAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dynamic_discoverer = DynamicObjectDiscoverer()
        self.static_patterns = CuratedCreationPatterns()  # Hand-crafted for complex cases
        self.method_classifier = FFIMethodClassifier()
        self.result_aggregator = MultiFormatExporter()
    
    def analyze(self):
        # Phase 1: Dynamic discovery (current system)
        discovered_objects = self.dynamic_discoverer.discover()
        
        # Phase 2: Static pattern enhancement for missing objects
        enhanced_objects = self.static_patterns.enhance(discovered_objects)
        
        # Phase 3: Comprehensive method analysis
        results = self.method_classifier.analyze_all_methods(enhanced_objects)
        
        # Phase 4: Multi-format export and visualization
        return self.result_aggregator.export_all_formats(results)
```

### Incremental Implementation Plan

1. **Keep current dynamic system as foundation** ‚úÖ
2. **Add static creation patterns for complex objects** (Subgraph, NeighborhoodResult)
3. **Implement method classification** (FFI vs Python, mutable vs immutable)  
4. **Add comprehensive export formats** (save_bundle resolution, CSV/Parquet)
5. **Build visualization and documentation layers**

- **Mitigation**: Hybrid approach with curated creation patterns for complex types
- **Owner**: Al (Engineer) + Zen (Python Manager)

### Medium Risk: Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Testing 557 methods may be slow for CI/CD integration
- **Mitigation**: Parallel execution + incremental testing + smart caching

### Medium Risk: API Breaking Changes
- **Risk**: Groggy API changes could break analysis system
- **Mitigation**: Version compatibility matrix + graceful degradation
- **Owner**: Dr. V (Visioneer) + Bridge (FFI Manager)

### Low Risk: Export Format Evolution
