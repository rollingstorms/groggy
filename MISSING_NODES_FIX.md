# Missing Nodes in Canvas Fix

## Problem

Nodes like "BaseTable" appeared in the table view but were invisible in the graph view, even though they existed in the graph with edges.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the position assignment logic in `handleSnapshot()`:

1. **Initial node creation** (line 377-378): All nodes start with `x: 0, y: 0`

2. **Position application** (line 445-453): When snapshot provides positions, only nodes with matching IDs in `snapshot.positions` get their x/y updated

3. **The bug**: If a node exists in `snapshot.nodes` but NOT in `snapshot.positions`, it stays at `x: 0, y: 0`

4. **Render filtering** (line 1444-1450): The render method skips nodes where `x === undefined || y === undefined`, BUT nodes at (0, 0) might be off-screen or overlapping

5. **Result**: Nodes without positions appear to be missing even though they're technically being "rendered" at (0, 0)

## Why Some Nodes Were Missing Positions

The snapshot's `positions` array may not include ALL nodes for several reasons:

1. **Layout algorithm limitations** - Some layouts may not position all nodes
2. **Partial snapshots** - Server may send positions incrementally  
3. **Node ID mismatches** - If node IDs don't match between nodes and positions arrays
4. **Synthetic nodes** - Auto-generated nodes (like result_type nodes) may not have layout positions

## The Fix

**File:** `web/app.js` lines 444-474

Added fallback position generation for nodes without positions:

```javascript
if (snapshot.positions && snapshot.positions.length > 0) {
    console.log(`üìç Applying ${snapshot.positions.length} node positions`);
    const positionedNodeIds = new Set();
    
    // Apply positions from snapshot
    for (const position of snapshot.positions) {
        const node = this.nodes.find(n => n.id === position.node_id);
        if (node && position.coords && position.coords.length >= 2) {
            node.x = position.coords[0] || 0;
            node.y = position.coords[1] || 0;
            positionedNodeIds.add(node.id);
        }
    }
    
    // Generate random positions for nodes WITHOUT positions
    const nodesWithoutPositions = this.nodes.filter(n => !positionedNodeIds.has(n.id));
    if (nodesWithoutPositions.length > 0) {
        console.log(`üìç Generating random positions for ${nodesWithoutPositions.length} nodes`);
        // ... circular layout for missing nodes ...
    }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Track positioned nodes**: Use a Set to remember which node IDs got positions from snapshot
2. **Find orphans**: Filter nodes to find ones without positions  
3. **Generate fallback positions**: Place orphan nodes in a circular layout
4. **Ensure visibility**: All nodes now have valid x/y coordinates and will render

## Benefits

1. **No missing nodes** - All nodes in the graph are visible on canvas
2. **Handles partial positions** - Works even if server only sends some positions
3. **Graceful degradation** - Falls back to circular layout for nodes without explicit positions
4. **Maintains performance** - Only generates positions for nodes that need them

## Testing

To verify the fix:

```python
import groggy as gr

# Load graph with many synthetic nodes
gt = gr.from_csv(
    nodes_filepath='comprehensive_test_objects.csv',
    edges_filepath='comprehensive_test_methods.csv',
    node_id_column='object_name',
    source_id_column='object_name',
    target_id_column='result_type'
)
g = gt.to_graph()

# This creates 54 nodes (27 original + 27 synthetic result_types)
# Some synthetic nodes may not get layout positions

g.viz.show(layout='circular')
```

**Expected behavior:**
- ‚úÖ All 54 nodes visible in graph view
- ‚úÖ All 54 nodes appear in table view
- ‚úÖ BaseTable node and its 142 edges (including 20 self-loops) are visible
- ‚úÖ Autofit button centers all nodes correctly

## Console Logs

After the fix, you should see:
```
üìç Applying 27 node positions
üìç Generating random positions for 27 nodes without positions
```

This indicates that some nodes got layout positions, and others got fallback circular positions.

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **All nodes have positions** - No fallback generation needed
2. **No nodes have positions** - Falls back to generateRandomPositions() (original behavior)
3. **Some nodes have positions** - NEW: Generates positions for missing nodes
4. **Position ID mismatches** - Nodes that can't be matched still get fallback positions

## Related Issues

This fix also resolves:
- Nodes appearing in table but not in graph
- Incomplete graph visualizations
- Autofit failing because some nodes are at (0, 0)
- Self-loops on nodes at origin appearing clustered
