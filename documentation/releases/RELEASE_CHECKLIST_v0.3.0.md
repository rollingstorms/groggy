## Success Criteria

For this release to be considered successful:

1. **✅ Core Functionality**: All storage view operations work correctly
2. **🔄 Performance**: Meets or exceeds performance benchmarks  
3. **✅ Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation available
4. **🔄 Stability**: No critical bugs in major workflows
5. **🔄 Usability**: Clear upgrade path and good user experience

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Document the issue** clearly with reproduction steps
2. **Assess impact** - can it be fixed quickly or requires major work?
3. **Decision point**:
   - Quick fix: Patch and re-release as v0.3.1
   - Major issue: Revert tag and delay release
4. **Communication**: Update users if release is delayed
