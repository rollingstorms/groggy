## System Overview

### Vision

**"A repository with development for years and aspirations to create a grand graph library that will be the foundation for algorithms to come."**

The persona system manages this grand vision by distributing expertise across specialized roles, ensuring that each aspect of the complex three-tier architecture receives focused attention while maintaining system-wide coherence.

### Core Principles

1. **Domain Expertise**: Each persona masters their specific technology stack and concerns
2. **Clear Ownership**: Unambiguous responsibility boundaries prevent gaps and overlaps
3. **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Cross-persona collaboration on architectural decisions
4. **Quality Gates**: Each persona enforces standards within their domain
5. **Long-term Vision**: Balance immediate needs with multi-year architectural goals

## Communication Protocols

### Daily Coordination

#### Morning Sync Pattern
1. **V** reviews overnight progress and sets daily priorities
2. **RM**, **FM**, **PM** report status and dependencies
3. **SO**, **SE** highlight quality concerns
4. **E**, **F** propose optimizations or architectural questions

#### Issue Escalation Chain
```text
Implementation Issue → Domain Manager → Dr. V
Safety Concern → Safety Officer → Dr. V  
Style Violation → Style Expert → Domain Manager
Cross-Domain Conflict → All Managers → Dr. V
```

### Weekly Planning

#### Architecture Review Meeting (Mondays)
- **V** presents architectural decisions needed
- **RM**, **FM**, **PM** discuss inter-layer impacts  
- **SO**, **SE** review compliance requirements
- **E**, **F** contribute technical insights

#### Code Quality Review (Fridays)
- **SE** presents style and documentation audit results
- **SO** reviews security and safety compliance
- Domain managers report on technical debt

### Monthly Strategic Planning

#### Vision Alignment Session
- **F** challenges current direction with big-picture questions
- **V** refines long-term roadmap based on learnings

## Decision-Making Framework

### Decision Types and Authority

#### Tier 1: Domain Decisions (Manager Authority)
- **RM**: Rust algorithm implementations, performance optimizations
- **FM**: FFI interface design, memory management strategies
- **PM**: Python API design, usability improvements

#### Tier 2: Cross-Domain Decisions (Collaborative)
- Interface contracts between layers → RM + FM + PM consensus
- Performance vs. safety trade-offs → SO + RM + FM input required
- Breaking changes → All managers + V approval

#### Tier 3: Strategic Decisions (Visioneer Authority)
- Major architectural changes → V decision after consultation
- Technology stack changes → V decision with specialist input
- Long-term roadmap → V decision with F input

### Consensus Building Process

1. **Proposal**: Any persona can propose changes in their domain
2. **Review**: Affected personas review and provide feedback

4. **Decision**: Authority level makes final decision
5. **Communication**: Decision communicated to all affected personas
6. **Implementation**: Responsible persona coordinates implementation

## Conflict Resolution

### Common Conflict Types

#### Performance vs. Safety
- **Scenario**: RM wants to use unsafe Rust for performance, SO objects
- **Resolution Process**: 
  1. SO and RM present their cases with data
  2. V evaluates trade-offs against project goals
  3. If approved, FSS works with RM to implement safely

#### API Consistency vs. Domain Optimization  
- **Scenario**: PM wants consistent API, RM has domain-specific optimizations
- **Resolution Process**:
  1. FM proposes abstraction layer to bridge differences
  2. SE evaluates impact on code clarity and documentation
  3. Managers negotiate compromise balancing consistency and performance

#### Technical Debt vs. Feature Development
- **Scenario**: E wants to refactor core algorithms, PM has user feature requests
- **Resolution Process**:
  1. V evaluates business impact and technical risk
  2. SE provides code quality assessment
  3. Phased approach balancing both needs

### Escalation Matrix

| Conflict Level | Resolution Forum | Decision Authority |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Implementation Details | Direct negotiation | Involved personas |
| Cross-Domain Interface | Weekly architecture review | Manager consensus |
| Strategic Direction | Monthly strategic planning | Dr. V |
| Emergency Issues | Immediate escalation | Dr. V |
