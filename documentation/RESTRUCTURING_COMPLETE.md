# API Documentation Restructuring - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** Successfully completed

---

## What Was Done

Successfully restructured Groggy's API documentation to **separate theory from API reference**, enabling systematic coverage of all 501 methods across 14 core objects.

---

## The Problem

Initial approach mixed conceptual explanations with method reference in the same documents:
- `docs/api/graph.md` - Had theory + incomplete method list
- `docs/api/subgraph.md` - Had theory + incomplete method list

This approach:
- ❌ Made it hard to find complete method documentation
- ❌ Mixed concerns (learning vs. reference)
- ❌ Couldn't scale to 501 methods across 14 objects

---

## The Solution

### Two Separate Documentation Tracks

**1. Theory/Usage Guides** (`docs/guide/`)
- Conceptual explanations
- Architecture deep dives
- Usage patterns and workflows
- Real-world examples
- Best practices

**2. Pure API Reference** (`docs/api/`)
- Systematic method documentation
- Complete method tables (all methods, no exceptions)
- Return types from empirical testing
- Method categorization
- Transformation paths

---

## What Was Created

### Templates

**1. Pure API Reference Template**
- File: `documentation/templates/pure_api_reference_template.md`
- Purpose: Systematic API documentation focused only on methods
- Structure:
  - Overview (one-sentence description, use cases, related objects)
  - Complete method reference table
  - Methods organized by category
  - Object transformation paths
  - Links to theory guides

**2. Theory/Usage Template** (existing, kept)
- File: `documentation/templates/api_page_template.md`
- Purpose: Conceptual guides with patterns and examples

### Scripts

**Pure API Page Generator**
- File: `documentation/scripts/generate_pure_api_pages.py`
- Purpose: Auto-generate API reference pages from meta-graph data
- Features:
  - Extracts all methods from comprehensive test meta-graph
  - Shows return types discovered empirically
  - Marks test success/failure status
  - Categorizes methods (Creation, Query, Transform, Algorithm, State, I/O)
  - Includes object metadata (use cases, transformations)

---

## Generated API Reference Pages

Successfully created 13 complete API reference pages covering **501 methods**:

| Object | Methods | File |
|--------|---------|------|
| Graph | 65 | `docs/api/graph.md` |
| Subgraph | 60 | `docs/api/subgraph.md` |
| BaseTable | 101 | `docs/api/basetable.md` |
| GraphMatrix | 93 | `docs/api/graphmatrix.md` |
| EdgesTable | 37 | `docs/api/edgestable.md` |
| NodesTable | 33 | `docs/api/nodestable.md` |
| GraphTable | 22 | `docs/api/graphtable.md` |
| NumArray | 17 | `docs/api/numarray.md` |
| EdgesAccessor | 16 | `docs/api/edgesaccessor.md` |
| NodesAccessor | 15 | `docs/api/nodesaccessor.md` |
| EdgesArray | 15 | `docs/api/edgesarray.md` |
| SubgraphArray | 14 | `docs/api/subgrapharray.md` |
| NodesArray | 13 | `docs/api/nodesarray.md` |
| **TOTAL** | **501** | **13 files** |

**Note:** BaseArray had no methods in test data (likely abstract base class).

## API Reference Page Structure

Each page follows this structure:

### 1. Overview
- Type signature
- One-sentence description
- Primary use cases (3-4 bullet points)
- Related objects

### 2. Complete Method Reference
- **Table format** with all methods (no exceptions)
- Columns: Method | Returns | Status
- Legend explaining status symbols (✓ = tested, ✗ = failed/untested, ? = unknown return)

### 3. Method Categories
Methods organized by purpose:
- **Creation & Construction**: Building and instantiating
- **Queries & Inspection**: Getting information
- **Transformations**: Converting to other object types
- **Algorithms**: Graph algorithms and computations
- **State Management**: Modifying state
- **I/O & Export**: Saving, loading, exporting

### 4. Object Transformations
- Explicit transformation paths (e.g., "Graph → Subgraph: `g.nodes[condition]`")
- Link to complete transformation graph

### 5. See Also
- Link to theory/usage guide
- Link to architecture docs
- Link to transformation docs

## Example: Subgraph API Reference

```markdown
# Subgraph API Reference

**Type**: `groggy.Subgraph`

## Overview

An immutable view into a subset of a Graph without copying data.

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Filtering nodes/edges by conditions
- Working with portions of large graphs
- Creating temporary working sets without copying

**Related Objects:**
- `Graph`
- `SubgraphArray`
- `GraphTable`

## Complete Method Reference

| Method | Returns | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `adj()` | `GraphMatrix` | ✓ |
| `adjacency_list()` | `dict` | ✓ |
| `connected_components()` | `ComponentsArray` | ✓ |
... (60 total methods)

## Method Categories

### Transformations
- **`table()`** → `GraphTable`
- **`to_graph()`** → `Graph`
- **`to_matrix()`** → `GraphMatrix`
...

## Object Transformations

- **Subgraph → Graph**: `sub.to_graph()`
- **Subgraph → GraphTable**: `sub.table()`
- **Subgraph → NodesAccessor**: `sub.nodes`
...
```

## Data Source: Comprehensive Test Meta-Graph

All method information extracted from:
- `comprehensive_test_objects_20251007_213534.csv`
- `comprehensive_test_methods_20251007_213534.csv`

Meta-graph contains:
- 921 method calls across 53 objects
- 501 methods in 14 core API objects
- Empirically discovered return types
- Test success/failure status

This ensures:
- ✅ Complete coverage (all tested methods documented)
- ✅ Accurate return types (from actual tests, not guesses)
- ✅ Validation status (shows what's been tested)
- ✅ Auto-sync with code (regenerate when tests change)

---

## What Was Deleted

Removed mixed-purpose API pages:
- ❌ `docs/api/graph.md` (old version, mixed theory/API)
- ❌ `docs/api/subgraph.md` (old version, mixed theory/API)

These pages combined conceptual explanations with incomplete method lists. The theory content should be moved to separate usage guides.

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Theory/Usage Guides

Need to create comprehensive guides for:
- `docs/guide/subgraphs.md` - Subgraph patterns and workflows
- `docs/guide/accessors.md` - NodesAccessor & EdgesAccessor tutorial
- `docs/guide/subgraph-arrays.md` - Working with collections
- `docs/guide/tables.md` - Tabular data operations
- `docs/guide/arrays.md` - Array operations and patterns
- `docs/guide/matrices.md` - Matrix representations and operations

### 2. Update mkdocs.yml Navigation

Add all 13 API reference pages to navigation:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About: about.md
  - Installation: install.md
  - Quickstart: quickstart.md

  - Concepts:
    - Overview: concepts/overview.md
    - Origins: concepts/origins.md
    - Architecture: concepts/architecture.md
    - Connected Views: concepts/connected-views.md

  - User Guides:
    - Graph Core: guide/graph-core.md
    - Subgraphs: guide/subgraphs.md
    - Accessors: guide/accessors.md
    - Tables: guide/tables.md
    - Arrays: guide/arrays.md
    - Matrices: guide/matrices.md

  - API Reference:
    - Graph Objects:
      - Graph: api/graph.md
      - Subgraph: api/subgraph.md
      - SubgraphArray: api/subgrapharray.md
    - Accessors:
      - NodesAccessor: api/nodesaccessor.md
      - EdgesAccessor: api/edgesaccessor.md
    - Tables:
      - GraphTable: api/graphtable.md
      - NodesTable: api/nodestable.md
      - EdgesTable: api/edgestable.md
      - BaseTable: api/basetable.md
    - Arrays:
      - NumArray: api/numarray.md
      - NodesArray: api/nodesarray.md
      - EdgesArray: api/edgesarray.md
    - Matrices:
      - GraphMatrix: api/graphmatrix.md
```

### 3. Extract Theory Content

The old mixed-purpose API pages had good theory sections. Extract and move to guides:
- Architecture explanations → `guide/` files
- Usage patterns → `guide/` files
- Performance notes → `guide/` files

### 4. Validate Links

Ensure all cross-references work:
- API pages link to guides
- Guides link to API pages
- Transformation paths are accurate

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **Complete coverage**: All 501 core methods documented
✅ **Systematic structure**: Every object follows same template
✅ **Empirical data**: Return types from actual tests, not guesses
✅ **Clear separation**: Theory vs. reference are distinct
✅ **Scalable approach**: Can regenerate as code evolves
✅ **Categorized methods**: Easy to find methods by purpose
✅ **Transformation paths**: Clear navigation between object types

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- ✅ Meta-graph provides reliable source of truth for methods
- ✅ Separating theory from reference improves both
- ✅ Template + script = consistent, complete documentation
- ✅ Categorizing methods aids discoverability
- ✅ Empirical return types more trustworthy than introspection

### What Didn't Work
- ❌ mkdocstrings incompatible with Rust/PyO3 classes
- ❌ Mixing theory with reference creates confusion
- ❌ Hand-writing 501 methods impractical

### Key Insight
**For a Rust-based library with Python bindings:**
- Can't rely on Python introspection tools
- Need empirical testing to discover API shape
- Meta-graph of test coverage is invaluable documentation source
- Separation of concerns essential at scale
